# Concordance Banking Example

This example illustrates all of the core event sourcing building blocks applied to a simplified banking model. In this sample, we have modeled a bank account aggregate, projector, process manager, and an artificial gateway that can be used for testing simulated inter-bank transfers (processes/sagas).

This particular repository is a template, meant to demonstrate a GitOps flow for deploying an application to Cosmonic. The application is a simple banking example, which is a fork of the [Concordance Banking Example](https://github.com/cosmonic/concordance/tree/main/examples/bankaccount).

Instructions forthcoming for using this repository.
